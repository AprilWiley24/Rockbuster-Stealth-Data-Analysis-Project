# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis-Project
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.  
  
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked a series of business questions and wanted data-driven answers that they could use for their 2020 company strategy. The data set used to answer these questions contained information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments among other things. The main questions they wanted to be answered were as follows:  

●  What are the top ten countries Rockbuster customers are based in?  
●  What are the top ten cities in the top ten countries?  
●  Where are customers with a high lifetime value-based?  
●  What was the average rental rate for all videos?  
●  What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
●  Which movies contributed the most to revenue gains?  
●  Which movies contributed the least to revenue gains?  
  
I used SQL to query Rockbuster's Relational Database Management System to answer these business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management board.
